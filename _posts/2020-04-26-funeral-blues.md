<h2>Farewelling a Friend</h2>

I recently found out that one of my dearest friends from university had died. I did not get the news quickly, but this seemed to add to my grief, for I was both grieving his loss and grieving the time since when I didn't know he was gone.

<h2>Goodbye, Jim</h2>

You were a good friend through university and in the decades since. I hope you found what you sought.
