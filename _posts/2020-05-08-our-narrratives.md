<h2>Therapy Podcast</h2>

<p>I enjoy podcasts and started thinking of creating a therapy podcast back in 2013. I was working full-time, a full-time daddy (my favourite and most important role) and spreading myself across a number of other things. I then became single in 2014 and had other things upon which to focus. Creating a podcast became a lesser priority.</p>

<h2>Counselling and Therapeutic Modalities</h2>

<p>Since I became a counsellor back in 2009, I have bounced a bit between modalities. As a student, the emphasis was upon Carl Rogers' <i>Person Centered Therapy</i>. This is a good starting point, but just that - a place to start. I then became interested in the various iterations of <i>Cognitive Therapy</i> (<i>Cognitive Therapy</i>, <i>Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy</i>, <i>Rational-Emotive Behavioural Therapy</i>), but they didn't seem enough. I then chanced upon <i>Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy</i> and felt this covered a few more bases in the approach I wanted to use. I realised that it was important for me to include mindfulness in some form in my therapeutic practice. Then there was <i>Narrative Therapy</i> and <i>Compassion-Focused Therapy</i> (among many others). All of these things began to come together to strengthen my practice. I have also been exploring <i>Positive Psychology</i> in the last few years.</p>

<h2>Narrative Therapy</h2>

<p>I began to consider that Narrative Therapy could be a framework from which I would work, supplemented by other modalities and tools - meditation, compassion meditation, cognitive therapeutic work, etc. I took a course last year in Adelaide, Australia, at the Centre where Narrative Therapy began. I continued to consider the possibilities after this course.</p>

<h2>Our Narratives</h2>

<p>The lock-down of COVID-19 has given me time to further explore possibilities. I have been working on audio resources for meditation and other things that might help others during self-isolation. Yesterday, I created a podcast and will be migrating some of these resources to that podcast.</p>

<p>The podcast is available at:</p>

<p>Content will be added over the following weeks, but I anticipate Narrative Therapy theory and sessions, guided meditation (mindfulness, compassion and chanting) and poetry that I might want to read.</p>
