<blockquote>

<p>For Mal had learned in his brief joyless life that nothing is faithful and that one neednâ€™t have a body to be able to mourn, for death is everywhere. Cyanide fills the peach pit. Meningitis in a napkin fold and polio on the wet shower boards. Eternity is in the evening air.</p>

<p>Joy Williams, in <i>Dimmer</i></p>
