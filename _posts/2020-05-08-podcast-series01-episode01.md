<p>Hello and welcome to the first episode of "Our Narratives".</p>

<p>This podcast is being created as a resource for those seeking to improve their own mental health. We cannot all afford weekly sessions of therapy, but we all need help at some time. I have been in this situation myself, raising a small child with limited support and even more limited funds.</p>

<p>After getting through my difficulties - in fact while in them - I decided that I wanted to help others. I was a week into single life, camping with my son. I say "camping", but we were living in a caravan only two months after the purchase of a home. It was very late at night and as my four year old son fell asleep next to me, I had a moment of clarity and realised that I would become a therapist. I heard a coyote howl in the distance and then I drifted off to sleep, my first peaceful moment in weeks.</p>

<p>Out of that experience, I did a Master of Counselling course and I began telephone counselling training in Christchurch Aotearoa New Zealand. I threw myself into this new life, looking forward to when I could help others who were suffering.</p>

<p>Over time I realised that one therapist can definitely help, but help only a few in traditional practice. Western therapy is modelled largely after 19th Century medical visits and this means personalised and expensive ongoing sessions where the therapist is considered the "expert" and the client is somehow defective or broken. Many avoid becoming therapists - I was one of these as an undergraduate - because they do not believe this pseudo-medical model to be an effective reflection of reality, either of people's psychological states or of the dynamics of human relationships.</p>

<p>What alternatives do we have to traditional therapy? There are no doubt evolving numerous alternatives to traditional therapy, including mobile app development augmented with Artificial Intelligence. While AI therapy may offer promise in the medium to long-term, more immediate options could include self-help guided by therapeutic models - the focus of this podcast - and group therapeutic models which are community-driven (think a secular version of Alcoholics Anonymous that offers assistance within therapeutic models). I am very interested in this sort of group work and am writing something on this at the moment. Perhaps I will publish something about this, soon.</p>

<p>As just stated, focusing on self-help through emphasising therapeutic models, meditation and other helpful tools will be the focus of this podcast. This will be augmented by things that inspire me, such as poetry readings between podcasts. How might these resources be helpful to you? We will explore the theory of models - including Narrative Therapy - and we will follow this with more practical discussions of what you might do to apply these tools in your own life. You might find that you are following narratives created by others and want to work on recreating the narratives of your life. You may find that you are engaging in negative self-talk and learn to practice compassion therapy to be more gentle and kind with yourself. You may find yourself focusing on the future a great deal and want to try meditation to bring yourself to the present, easing your anxiety. The goal is to discuss things that you might be able to use to help yourself through difficult times and perhaps even helping you to develop more positive habits and outlooks for the future.</p>

<p>Do these goals seem ambitious? Yes! Are they needed? Yes! Too many are suffering from mental health issues because they cannot access help. This podcast won't resolve all of the issues, but is this helper's attempt to share what I have learned on my own journey.</p>

<p>While there will be many tools explored in this podcast - including meditation, compassion-focused meditation, cognitive therapy theory and exercises and insights from Positive Psychotherapy, among other things, we need a framework in which to work. This gives us a way to conceptualise the topics we are going to discuss. That framework will be Narrative Therapy.</p>

<p>What is Narrative Therapy? Narrative Therapy is an approach to problems which imagines our mental world as being made up of stories or "narratives". Some of the narratives we tell ourselves about our own existence, but many of these stories are told to us from birth. Stories of cultures, sub-cultures, families and individuals. We are surrounded by stories and when we get new input, we try to either fit this information into current stories, or create new stories. Most of us never challenge the main or "dominant" stories of our lives and these stories are not always helpful for our mental states or functioning. Narrative Therapy attempts to help consider these stories and when useful to help us rewrite our stories.<p>

<p>OK, so we all have stories and some stories are either not helpful or actually harmful. If we accept this idea of narratives, what do we do to help resolve the problems? Well, Narrative Therapy has us examine these dominant stories. We look at the stories of our lives during the therapy session. How is this done? We tell stories that are important to us. Most people do this naturally when they come to therapy. They have a lot on their minds and they want to talk about what is bothering them. These problems generally present as stories of things that have happened in their lives. In Narrative Therapy, we work through these stories with the therapist. Verbalising these stories can have its own therapeutic value, as the client sees patterns in his or her own life. Seeing these patterns are a start, but not enough. Some might even have an idea of the power of these stories over their lives before beginning therapy, but don't know what to do about them. What is next?</p>

<p>As we tell our stories, we often mention things that don't exactly fit in the story. This can be a time when things didn't go as we assumed they would or it can be a time when we were outright confused by the outcome. Our minds have a strong urge to look for patterns to make meaning, so when there is something that doesn't fit a larger pattern, it is quite normal for us to dismiss this anomaly. In fact, we are generally so good at ignoring these anomalies that we have difficulty remembering them later. One of the tasks of the therapist is to listen to our stories, noting any references we make to things that don't fit our dominant, problem-saturated stories. Over time, the therapist has a number of exceptions to bring to the client's attention, perhaps starting with something like, "You mention two times when things didn't go as planned. Let's look at those times."</p>

<p>One thing to note here is that the exceptions might be actual events, or they might be mental states. That is, the client might have mentally rebelled against something or imagined something better in place of what was happening. While we often attach greater significance to events than thought processes, these remembered thoughts can also become the basis for exceptions to dominant stories.</p>
