I woke up to the sound of rain overflowing the spouting, hitting the pavement. I like the rain. Always have - except for when I was eleven and was on my paper route. This morning, I lay in bed, listening to the rain, feeling content.

My mind dropped back 30 years. I was 19 and an undergraduate studying theology. Then 20 years, I was in law school dating an Aussie and thinking of moving Down Under. As I listened to the rain, so many images flooded my mind.

There are moments when you realise how lucky you are.

I wanted to end this with that last sentence, but also want to say that we all have darkness in our lives. The question is not whether it will come, but how we will react to those times. You might be trying to hold yourself and your family together through these moments. You might feel that you are barely staying afloat. These moments show you who you really are - the person behind the projections, behind the social fa√ßade. When I look back on my life with contentment, I also see those times, but I don't focus on the pain (it does subside), but on how I behaved for those I love.

A blissful 49th birthday, listening to the rain.
